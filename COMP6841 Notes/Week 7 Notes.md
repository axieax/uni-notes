# Tutorial: Case Study 7: Problem

- Mission duration near 6 days
- Last minute crew change - sickness vs practice
- Little interest in "routine" mission until incident occured
- Issue with routine cryo stir for the oxygen tank, where the damaged wiring inside ignited an explosion causing an oxygen tank explosion
- Many issues - required improvisation - change goal from landing on the moon to getting the astronauts back to Earth safely
  - Limited oxygen
  - Limited power
    - Shut down computers
    - Simulation on Earth for starting computer with only 20 amps of electrical current available
    - Manual manoeuvre of the rocket
    - No waste disposal
  - Excessive carbon dioxide
    - Improvised a mechanism from simulating available resources on the rocket
  - Cold - inedible food, lethargy from lack of sleep
- Teamwork both on the rocket and back on Earth
  - Failure is not an option
  - Relentless determination for solving seemingly impossible challenges - "you need a break?" "If they don't get one, I don't get one."
  - Communication is crucial
  - Running simulations on Earth with conditions on the rocket to try to come up with feasible solutions
  - Checks of references from multiple sources for calculations
  - Prayers from around the world
- Changes
  - Another cryo oxygen tank that could be isolated to only supply the crew.
  - Removing all cryo tank fans and wiring.
  - Removing the thermostats from cryo tanks, and changing the type of heater tube.
  - Adding a 400-amp-hour lunar module descent stage battery.
  - Adding water storage bags to the command module.

- Decentralised control
- Conflict of interest
- Communication
