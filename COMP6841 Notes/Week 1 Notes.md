## Attacker mindset

Thinking like a defender, as counter-intuitive as it may sound, is problematic in security.  It’s easy to get tunnel vision as a defender and overlook areas which are obvious to attackers who have different skills, attitudes and experiences to us. Humans tend to be led into a false sense of security when it comes to reviewing their own work. Have you ever come up with a solution to a problem, only to have significant flaws pointed out after receiving feedback from others? When we only look at a problem from our own perspective, we are bound to overlook areas that others will notice. There’s a simple, but effective adjustment we can make to our way of thinking to improve our defence against attackers. And that’s to think like one.

To truly understand how secure a system is, a defender may hire someone to breach their system. This way vulnerabilities can be identified during pre-deployment. For example a home security company may focus all of their time and effort on a biometric protected access system for the front door and garage of a home. But upon hiring someone to breach the system, the attacker just climbs in through an unlocked window.

History of cyber

- Microsoft money (online banking)
- Specialisation
- Vulnerability (defect) vs Exploit (getting in)
- Market for 0day's, exploits (pay for services) - market prices indicating security
- Attackers attacking all the time

Mandiant report - 243 median number of days advanced attackers are on the network before being detected

Plane

- Not jumping on first thought
- Looking at bullet shots leading to plane survival rather than non-survival

Data vs Control



Engineering reasonableness check for estimation

\# ants in a room - measuring in smaller chunks rather than volume (gut feeling)

Hallax ship - commision to blame, rather than solve/prevent/response(evacuate)
