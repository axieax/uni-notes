Prove not continuous at a point by providing a series as a counter example

Use pinching theorem for showing complicated limit goes to something



Clariut's Theorem only works if all partial derivatives exist and are continuous around a

Local min/max/saddle point - depends on eigenvalues

- Determinant - product of eigenvalues
- Trace - sum of eigenvalues
- Both eigenvalues > 0: minimum
  - Determinant > 0 and trace > 0
- Both eigenvalues < 0: maximum
  - Determinant > 0 and trace < 0
- Eigenvalues different signs: saddle point
  - Determinant < 0

Lagrange Multiplier

- Max/min f subject to constraints S = $\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : \phi(\mathbf{x}) = c\}$ (smooth surface)
- $\nabla f(a) = \lambda \nabla \phi(a)$, gradients parallel
- Condition: $\nabla \phi(a) \neq \mathbf{0}$



Determinant determines how much an area increases under a transformation
