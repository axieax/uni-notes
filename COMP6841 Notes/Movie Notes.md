# Week 1: WarGames (1983)

- **Single point failures** can occur with centralising power and control at the top
- Backdoors (intentional vulnerabilities) can allow for insider attacks
- Difficult to verify data integrity and accuracy (esp from computers)
- Balance roles of humans and computers
  - e.g. ending: failsafe launch code bruteforce in design
- Tradeoffs to everything in security design - including passwords (common, simple, accessible etc.)
  - e.g. entry to principal's office area was secure, although the area itself was not very secure
- Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) - there is no winner, like computer-simulated Tic-Tac-Toe draws

# Week 2: 12 Angry Men (1957)

- Type 1 vs type 2 errors: looking at evidence of someone being guilty vs evidence of someone not being guilty
- Votes - secrets (anonymity) reveal true opinions
- Taking the time to examine a problem from a different perspective can reveal important details
- Data integrity and trustworthiness
- Biases can prevent people from changing their minds / perspectives - listen to other's opinions - people see what they want to see (prejudice) - difficult to change mind (e.g. social conformity bad for defender mindset - everyone says it's secure)
- Diversity important for different perspectives, empathy not just facts (human elements)
- Expand on reasonable doubt
