# Monday Lecture



# Tuesday Lecture

Just culture

- Simplification
- Wedging - set up to fail
- Root cause analysis
- Two separate roles checking in on each other - can fall apart if one person changes from one role to the other
- Reliance on trust - trusted third party
- Commitment
  - Can replace trust
  - Deciding on something
  - Both parties input
  - Needs to be public - e.g. exchanges hashes (one way)







# Tutorial: Case Study 10 - Electronic Self Drive Cars

Top assets of the country that you are concerned about (important thingies)

- Taxi / Uber drivers - jobs replaced - loss of transportation industry
- Public transport?
- Congestion with a greater reliance on road?
- Pedestrian safety (trust)
- Passenger safety
- Traffic
- Trust with centralised control
- Consumer and company data

Top risks you are concerned about

- Hijacked cars - ddos
- Lack of moral decisions (trolly problem)
- Mechanical failures - software issues / bugs could cause accidents - a issue in all similar cars could be a very big issue
- Skewed data -> bad decision
- Speeding fines
- Integrity of system - malicious modifications can be loaded into cars

What should be done to address each risk and who should do it

- Stronger penetration testing by white-hat hackers, security by design - maybe isolated systems? (5G, navigation though)
- Who is to blame when an accident occurs - manufacturer? (insurance) - Allow computers to make moral decisions - could be bad and against Asimov's three rules - pedestrian > passenger? - passenger safety over own integrity
- Bugs are common, need strong backup / preventative measures which ensures cars don't crash, testing, manual override

Recommendation: should we change the legislation to allow driverless cars be allowed on the road

- Yes
  - Pros
    - Safer than human drivers - e.g. drunk driving, fatigue, concentration lapses
    - Better traffic if cars can communicate with each other effectively
  - Cons
    - Security of technology
    - Reliance on technology even though there may be errors in technology
  - Having non-driverless cars on the road as well
    - Pros
      - More flexibility in choice
    - Cons
      - A bad human decision can stuff up an entire network and break driverless cars
        - Driverless cars can still have accident avoidance measures
        - Human-induced congestion may cause driveless cars to be stagnant or make bad decisions
          - There should be a manual override option available as well

# End of Course Reflection

Looking back over what I've achieved over the term and realising that I've invested more than 238 hours on this course alone, I have to admit that I have found a genuine passion for security, being motivated to learn about several concepts beyond the course through researching in the activities and from my Something Awesome Project. Although I really enjoyed working on my Something Awesome Project, causing me to spend more time on it than anticipated, I was also just as glad that it was finally over, as I had never completed a technical project of such scale before. Richard's lectures were also very fascinating and engaging, where I was able to learn a lot when I was able to attend the live lectures. Attending the last ones live in Week 10 before the term was over was very rewarding, where I got to talk to Richard and listen to a very interesting lecture about commitment. I also learned a lot about security analysis from the movie nights I were able to attend in the first half of the term, which was greatly beneficial in allowing me to find my "security eyes". Although I enjoyed my tutorial group, I found that these, as well as the weekly quizzes, were my least favourite part of the course, mainly because of the case studies, which I would have already prepared for, for topics I don't find as interesting as practical security topics, usually involving law-related topics and debate-style discussions. Although I was definitely given and took advantage of the opportunity for improving my communication skills, I found that our discussions became quite bland after an hour when we had exhausted it, which seems to be a common consensus amongst the class. However, my favourite case study was in my Week 10 tutorial, where we discussed the risks with electronic self driving cars. Without being able to prepare beforehand, I enjoyed how we were able to come up with an exhaustive list of valid ideas for the case study as a class, which was definitely a very engaging exercises where I contributed heavily during group and class discussions. 

In terms of professional skills, I have definitely worked on my time management skills, where I had to balance four university courses, two society director roles and two peer mentoring roles this term (which unfortunately meant I had to pause my SWE job as well). Although I've spent a lot of time on this course, I believe I've also been able to gain a lot from it, as mentioned before. Although being presented with so many opportunities for communication and community engagement was quite overwhelming at first, especially after the COVID lockdowns, I decided to embrace it and participate more on online and live discussions related to security. I've also enjoyed using my analytical skills with my improved security mindset, tackling difficult challenges such as my Something Awesome Project and some of the Wargames, requiring me to have a strong understanding of relevant concepts. I am also very glad I took the extended version (which I usually would do anyways), where exploring some of the more practical and technical components was definitely my favourite aspect of the course, which was very rewarding as well. I am keen to do some more security courses in the future, hopefully less time-consuming ones :)
