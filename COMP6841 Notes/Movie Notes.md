# WarGames (1983)

**Single point failures** can occur with centralising power and control at the top

Backdoors (intentional vulnerabilities) can allow for insider attacks

Difficult to verify data integrity and accuracy (esp from computers)

Balance roles of humans and computers

- e.g. ending: failsafe launch code bruteforce in design

Tradeoffs to everything in security design - including passwords (common, simple, accessible etc.)

- e.g. entry to principal's office area was secure, although the area itself was not very secure

Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) - there is no winner, like computer-simulated Tic-Tac-Toe draws
