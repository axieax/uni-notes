# Tuesday Lecture

Just culture

- Simplification
- Wedging - set up to fail
- Root cause analysis
- Two separate roles checking in on each other - can fall apart if one person changes from one role to the other
- Reliance on trust - trusted third party
- Commitment
  - Can replace trust
  - Deciding on something
  - Both parties input
  - Needs to be public - e.g. exchanges hashes (one way)







# Tutorial: Case Study 10 - Electronic Self Drive Cars

Top assets of the country that you are concerned about (important thingies)

- Taxi / Uber drivers - jobs replaced - loss of transportation industry
- Public transport?
- Congestion with a greater reliance on road?
- Pedestrian safety (trust)
- Passenger safety
- Traffic
- Trust with centralised control
- Consumer and company data

Top risks you are concerned about

- Hijacked cars - ddos
- Lack of moral decisions (trolly problem)
- Mechanical failures - software issues / bugs could cause accidents - a issue in all similar cars could be a very big issue
- Skewed data -> bad decision
- Speeding fines
- Integrity of system - malicious modifications can be loaded into cars

What should be done to address each risk and who should do it

- Stronger penetration testing by white-hat hackers, security by design - maybe isolated systems? (5G, navigation though)
- Who is to blame when an accident occurs - manufacturer? (insurance) - Allow computers to make moral decisions - could be bad and against Asimov's three rules - pedestrian > passenger? - passenger safety over own integrity
- Bugs are common, need strong backup / preventative measures which ensures cars don't crash, testing, manual override

Recommendation: should we change the legislation to allow driverless cars be allowed on the road

- Yes
  - Pros
    - Safer than human drivers - e.g. drunk driving, fatigue, concentration lapses
    - Better traffic if cars can communicate with each other effectively
  - Cons
    - Security of technology
    - Reliance on technology even though there may be errors in technology
  - Having non-driverless cars on the road as well
    - Pros
      - More flexibility in choice
    - Cons
      - A bad human decision can stuff up an entire network and break driverless cars
        - Driverless cars can still have accident avoidance measures
        - Human-induced congestion may cause driveless cars to be stagnant or make bad decisions
          - There should be a manual override option available as well
