# Week 1: WarGames (1983)

- **Single point failures** can occur with centralising power and control at the top
- Backdoors (intentional vulnerabilities) can allow for insider attacks
- Difficult to verify data integrity and accuracy (esp from computers)
- Balance roles of humans and computers
  - e.g. ending: failsafe launch code bruteforce in design
- Tradeoffs to everything in security design - including passwords (common, simple, accessible etc.)
  - e.g. entry to principal's office area was secure, although the area itself was not very secure
- Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) - there is no winner, like computer-simulated Tic-Tac-Toe draws

# Week 2: 12 Angry Men (1957)

- Type 1 vs type 2 errors: looking at evidence of someone being guilty vs evidence of someone not being guilty
- Votes - secrets (anonymity) reveal true opinions
- Taking the time to examine a problem from a different perspective can reveal important details
- Data integrity and trustworthiness
- Biases can prevent people from changing their minds / perspectives - listen to other's opinions - people see what they want to see (prejudice) - difficult to change mind (e.g. social conformity bad for defender mindset - everyone says it's secure)
- Diversity important for different perspectives, empathy not just facts (human elements)
- Expand on reasonable doubt

# Week 3: The Sting (1973)

- A lot of misdirection in this movie
  - When the women wishes the main character goodnight, we initially think nothing of it, but this was actually the motivation for the assassin not to kill him that night because someone else had seen him
  - Not expecting the assassin to be a woman, because the director sets us up to expect the director to be a man
  - We as an audience is tricked
  - Characters within movie are also tricked
- Using emotion to trick people
  - During the poker scene, the main character does everything to market the target angry and part with more of his money
  - Humans are very easy to trick
- Classic tricks
  - Running one direction, and then hiding behind a moving car in the opposite direction
- A good scam
  - A good scam works because we trust or rely on a source that's been unknowingly corrupted
  - In the movie, the people thought it was implausible that all 20 people in the room are in on the trick

# Week 4: The Truman Show
