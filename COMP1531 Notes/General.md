# General/Random Notes

- Watch out for edge cases
- Raise Exception if necessary - make sure to have test cases reflect assumptions

add lists using + --> e.g. [1] + [2] = [1, 2]

Agile - responding to change valued over following a plan

Agile INVEST: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Sized-Appropriately, Testable

Acceptance tests are always black box tests

HTTP/s is the protocol

cyclomatic complexity: e-n+2

cohesion

Bad smell: mutating something you are iterating over (removing elements whilst iterating through a list)

- use list comprehension instead: [x for x in list if not _]
