# Week 1: The Foundations of Cybersecurity

# Community

## Wisdom

Start your degree sharing a quote you love

```
Share a great quote that you really like. 
Post it as a comment on the course homepage.
Try to post one that hasn't already been posted by someone else.
Use "like" and comment to respond to a few of the great quotes your classmates shared as well. A quote can be a gift that helps you remember what's important when things seem tough.
You might want to write a brief post in your log about why you picked your quote and what it means to you.
```

- "The key is not to prioritise what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities" - Stephen Covey
- Discussing having a reactive vs proactive mindset in today's security lecture reminded me of this quote from Stephen Covey, which emphasises the importance of taking control of a situation (being proactive) rather than letting the situation control you (reactive approach). Although I am generally more of a reserved and reactive individual, I tend to be more proactive in the work I do, realising that many problems can be mitigated through proactive and creative thinking earlier on. Furthermore, this quote symbolises how I am able to manage my time so effectively, whilst balancing so many commitments at the same time.

## Security Everywhere

Over the week share a news story or a photo of something you notice which demonstrates one of this week's concepts.

```
Make a blog entry about what you have noticed. It can be as brief as you want but it needs to include an image. A photo and a few words describing it is fine.
Post a summary comment linking to the blog post on the course homepage. The summary comment should include the image, the link to your blog post, and a few words about it (so people can decide if they want to read further).
Comment on any you are impressed by or which make you think.
We'll do this again each week.

## Thinking like an attacker

Learn about and look for examples of the attacker mindset

```
In this activity you will be figuring out the best way to stop a burglar from finding your valuables if they are already inside your house. Where is the best safest place to hide your jewels? (https://momento360.com/e/u/2e37b96d54bb4910b272143aaffc545f)
Enter full screen mode, and pan around the room in order to choose a location you think could be best suited to stashing your valuables. We encourage you to think outside of the box, and use those security eyes in order to defend against attackers.
Post your chosen hiding spot in your blog, and describe how you might obscure, protect or otherwise make it harder for a burglar to find or capture your valuables.
Post a summary comment linking to your blog post and setting out your main idea below.  Include a small 200x200 picture showing where in the room you would hide it. (To do this take a screen shot of the area, crop and resize it to be 200x200 and draw a red circle around the spot).
Vote on where you think the most common place people would hide their valuables in this room.
```

1. Best location for stashing your valuables (defender mindset): hiding them at the top of the curtains (horizontal pole). (top of the curtain rail)
   - Not in plain sight
   - Uncommon hiding spot
   - Unlikely to be thoroughly checked as the window faces the street, which would reveal / create suspicion for the burglar (who would most likely avoid)
